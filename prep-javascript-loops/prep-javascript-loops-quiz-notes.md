## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is the purpose of the **condition** expression in the `for` and `while` loops?
  for statement creates a loop that consists of three optional expressions, enclosed in parentheses and separated by semicolons, followed by a statement (usually a block statement) to be executed in the loop.
  while statement creates a loop that executes a specified statement as long as the test condition evaluates to true. The condition is evaluated before executing the statement.
- When is the first expression in the parentheses for a `for` loop (known as the **initialization**) evaluated?
  It's evaluated before the loop begins.
- When is the second expression in the parentheses for a `for` loop (known as the **condition**) evaluated?
  Second expression is evaluated before each loop iteration.
- When is the third expression in the parentheses for a `for` loop (known as the **final expression**) evaluated?
  An expression to be evaluated at the end of each loop iteration.

- What is the purpose of the **final expression** in a `for` loop?
  This occurs before the next evaluation of condition. Generally used to update or increment the counter variable.
- What types of data should the `for...in` loop be used on?
  The for...in statement iterates over all enumerable string properties of an object (ignoring properties keyed by symbols), including inherited enumerable properties.
